# COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization (Our World in Data)

This project provides a basic exploratory data analysis and visualization of the COVID-19 pandemic using the Our World in Data dataset. It focuses on understanding trends in total cases, deaths, and vaccinations for selected countries (Kenya, USA, India).

## Objectives

The primary goals of this project are to:

* Load and explore the structure of the comprehensive COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data.
* Clean and prepare the data for analysis, focusing on specific countries of interest.
* Visualize the trends of total COVID-19 cases and deaths over time for the selected countries.
* Compare the daily new cases across these countries.
* Calculate and visualize the death rate (total deaths / total cases) for each country.
* Analyze and visualize the progress of cumulative vaccination efforts in the chosen countries.
* (Optional) Provide a global perspective on case distribution using a choropleth map.
* Document key insights and observations derived from the data exploration and visualizations.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* **Python:** The core programming language for this project.
* **pandas:** Essential for data manipulation, cleaning, and analysis using DataFrames.
* **matplotlib:** A fundamental library for creating static, interactive, and animated plots in Python.
* **seaborn:** Built on top of matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.
* **plotly.express:** (Optional) Used for creating interactive visualizations, including the global choropleth map.

## How to Run/View the Project

1.  **Download the Dataset:**
    * Download the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from the [Our World in Data website](https://ourworldindata.org/covid-cases) and save it in the same directory as the Python script.

2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    * Ensure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
    * Open your terminal or command prompt and install the necessary Python libraries using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
        ```

3.  **Run the Python Script:**
    * Save the provided Python script (e.g., `covid_analysis.py`) in the same directory as the `owid-covid-data.csv` file.
    * Open your terminal or command prompt, navigate to the project directory, and execute the script:
        ```bash
        python covid_analysis.py
        ```

4.  **View Results:**
    * The script will output basic data exploration and analysis information in the console.
    * Visualizations will be saved as `.png` files in the project directory:
        * `total_cases_over_time.png`
        * `total_deaths_over_time.png`
        * `daily_new_cases.png`
        * `death_rate_over_time.png`
        * `cumulative_vaccinations.png`
    * If the `plotly` library is installed, an interactive choropleth map visualizing total cases per million for the latest date will be displayed in your default web browser.

## Insights and Reflections

* The trends in total cases and deaths for Kenya, USA, and India illustrate the varying impact and progression of the pandemic in different geographical regions. The slopes of the lines in the time-series plots indicate the rate of infection and mortality.
* Comparing the daily new cases highlights the different waves and surges experienced by each country, potentially reflecting variations in public health measures, variant spread, and population behavior.
* The calculated death rate provides a basic measure of the severity of the pandemic in each country, although it's important to note that this metric can be influenced by various factors like testing rates and healthcare system capacity.
* The cumulative vaccination plots demonstrate the progress of vaccination campaigns in the selected countries. The rate of increase in vaccinations can indicate the speed and scale of the rollout efforts.
* (If the choropleth map is viewed) The global distribution of total cases per million offers a snapshot of the pandemic's intensity across the world at a specific point in time, revealing regions with higher and lower reported case burdens.

This project provides a foundational analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic using a readily available and comprehensive dataset. Further exploration could delve into the impact of specific interventions, the analysis of other relevant variables (e.g., hospitalizations, testing rates), and more detailed regional comparisons. The dynamic nature of the pandemic underscores the importance of continuous data monitoring and analysis.
